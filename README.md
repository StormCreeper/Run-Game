# Run-Game
Run is a game made using c++ and OpenGL. It is oriented towards destruction and procedural generation.
It has been initiated for the weekly game jam #160, and all assets have been made during this week or after.

## Usage
There is a sln file for compiling with visual studio, but you can compile with the compiler you want (you may have to change the code depending on your compiler).
You will have to link :
-[GLM](https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.9/index.html)
-[OpenAL](https://openal.org/)
-[Glad](https://glad.dav1d.de/#profile=core&language=c&specification=gl&loader=on&api=gl%3D4.3&extensions=GL_ARB_compute_shader&extensions=GL_ARB_compute_variable_group_size)
-[GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/)
-[GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/)
-[libsndfile](http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/)

In the future I might include these files in the repos.
